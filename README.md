# 120 FPS Unlock Wuwa Launcher

This tool is a launcher that unlocks 120 FPS on unsupported GPUs and CPUs for Wuthering Waves. It avoids potential issues with setting `LocalStorage.db` as read-only or tampering with folder permissions (can't change settings in-game, exclamation marks return every launch, ... etc).

## Latest Version

2.2

## How to Use

- Change `config.json` to match the directory where your game is installed (the folder where `launcher.exe` can be found).
- Double click the exe (if you downloaded from releases) or `python ww_120_fps_launcher.py`

## Releases

A prebuilt exe is available in releases tab.
